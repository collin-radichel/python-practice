ERRORS

SyntaxError - means there is something wrong with the way your program is written â€”
              punctuation that does not belong, a command where it is not expected,
              or a missing parenthesis can all trigger a SyntaxError.

NameError - occurs when the Python interpreter sees a word it
            does not recognize. Code that contains something that
            looks like a variable but was never defined will throw
            a NameError.

ZeroDivisionError - Python will raise this error when attempting to divide by 0


DATA TYPES

    int - whole numbers -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
    float - fractional numbers 1.5, 20.668
